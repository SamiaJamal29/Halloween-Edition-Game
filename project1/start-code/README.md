//Description
*It seems like "Snakes and Ladders" is a classic board game played with a numbered grid. Players take turns rolling a die and move their game piece along the numbered squares. The goal is to reach the final square. The game features some icons that allow players to go to higher-numbered squares quickly and other icons that force players to slide down to lower-numbered squares. It's a game of chance and luck, where the first player to reach the last square is the winner.
